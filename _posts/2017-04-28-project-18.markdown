description: This was an ecommerce site with requirements being it to be responsive, and it must use the company's existing ERP software to manage the storefront.  I worked with the key stakeholder, 3 developers, and a team of item fulfillment staff to provide a custom solution and successfully moved the data from the existing Drupal/Ubercart site to a site which uses Joomla! and PHP to manage content and communicate with the company's ERP software.
